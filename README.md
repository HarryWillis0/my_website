# my_website (work in progress)

## Overview

This is a personal website project where I can implement some app basics with new languages and frameworks I want to learn. The plan is to have multiple implementations of the same site using different frameworks, languages, databases etc. as I want to learn them.

## Project struture

/frontends/

- contains all code pertaining to UI
- each subfolder will be a specific implementation using a certain UI framework

/backends/

- contains all code pertaining to APIs and servers

/backends/servers

- contains the server that will serve the UI
- each subfolder will be a specific implementaion using a certain language ex. /backends/servers/node will be a node server serving one of the frontends

/backends/apis

- each subfolder will be a specific implementation of the same API for a certain language/framework
