# my_website (work in progress)

## Overview

This is a personal project where I will implement app basics with new languages and frameworks I want to learn. I plan to have multiple iterations of the site using different frameworks, languages, databases, etc.

## Project struture

/frontends/

-   contains all code pertaining to UI
-   each subfolder will be a specific implementation using a certain UI framework
    -   ex. /frontends/react contains the React implementation

/backends/

-   contains all code pertaining to APIs and servers

/backends/servers

-   contains the server that will serve the UI
-   each subfolder will be a specific implementaion using a certain language
    -   ex. /backends/servers/node contains the Node.js implementation of the server

/backends/apis

-   contains the API code for interacting with a database
-   each subfolder will be a specific implementation of the same API for a certain language/framework
    -   ex. /backends/apis/go contains the Go implementation of the API
