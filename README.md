## Overview

This is a personal project where I implement app basics with new languages and frameworks I want to learn.

## Project struture

```
my_website/
│
├── frontends/
│   └── react/
│
└── backends/
    └── servers/
    │   ├── go/
    │    └── node/

```

### Directory Notes

**Frontend Directories**: Each frontends directory contains the implementation of the website in a specific language and framework.

**Backend Directories**: Each backends servers directory contains the implementation of the website server in a specific language and framework. Each backends api directory contains the implementation of the API the website uses.
